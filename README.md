# WakeyWakey

A tiny macOS menu bar app that keeps your Mac awake by simulating subtle user activity only when you’ve been idle.

- Menu bar only (no Dock icon)
- Enable/Disable toggle with clear icon state
- Timer options: enable for 1, 4, or 8 hours with auto-disable
- Launch at Login toggle (integrates with System Settings)
- Generates small, random mouse movements only after 42 seconds of inactivity, then at randomized 42–79 second intervals
- Prevents system idle sleep while enabled


## Requirements
- macOS 15.0 or later
- Xcode with macOS 15 SDK
- Homebrew (for XcodeGen)
- Accessibility permission (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility)


## How it works (current behavior)
- When you click Enable:
  - The app sets an IOPM idle-sleep prevention assertion (so the system won’t sleep)
  - It waits until you’ve been idle for at least 42 seconds
  - Then it performs a single, small cursor move at random intervals between 42–79 seconds
    - Each move shifts the cursor by independent random dx and dy between 11–23 pixels in random directions
    - Movements are clamped within the current screen under the cursor and anchored to the main display’s coordinate origin to avoid snapping; works across multiple monitors (including DisplayLink)
    - 52% of jiggles bias the cursor toward the center of the current screen; 48% are random small moves
- Timer options (Enable for 1/4/8 hours):
  - Enables immediately if not already enabled
  - Auto-disables when the timer expires
  - Manual disable clears any active timer
- Launch at Login:
  - Toggle in menu adds/removes app from System Settings → Login Items
  - State persists via SMAppService (no restart required)
- When you click Disable:
  - Sleep prevention and activity generation stop immediately
- Menu bar icon:
  - Disabled: SF Symbol cup.and.saucer (empty cup)
  - Enabled: SF Symbol cup.and.saucer.fill (full cup)

```


## Setup
1) Install XcodeGen (one time)
```
brew install xcodegen
```

2) Generate the Xcode project
```
./scripts/generate_project.sh
```

3) (Optional) Regenerate AppIcon from the provided PNG if you change it
```
./scripts/generate_appicon.sh
```


## Build, install, and run (Debug)
```
./scripts/build_debug.sh
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```
- First launch may prompt for Accessibility permission. If the permission dialog does not appear, go to:
  System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility, add WakeyWakey, enable it, then relaunch the app.

- To stop the app:
```
./scripts/kill.sh
```


## Release build and distribution

### Quick release (recommended)
Create a DMG with drag-to-Applications installer:
```
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
```
This builds the app and creates `dist/WakeyWakey-1.0.0.dmg`.

To also publish to GitHub:
```
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0 --publish
```
This creates the DMG, tags the release, and uploads to GitHub Releases.

Requires: `brew install create-dmg`

### Manual release build
Create a Release build:
```
./scripts/build_release.sh
```
The resulting app is here:
```
build/Build/Products/Release/WakeyWakey.app
```
Copy to Applications on this Mac:
```
cp -R build/Build/Products/Release/WakeyWakey.app /Applications/
```

### Install on another Mac
- Download the DMG from GitHub Releases (or transfer via AirDrop/scp)
- Open the DMG and drag WakeyWakey to Applications
- First run may require Control-click > Open (Gatekeeper)
- Grant Accessibility permissions, then relaunch


## Configuration
- Bundle ID: `com.brndnsvr.WakeyWakey` (set in Info.plist and project.yml)
- Deployment target: macOS 15.0 (project.yml)
- Architecture: arm64 only for Debug and Release builds (project.yml and scripts)
- Code signing: Automatic; the project is configured with your Team ID
  - To change team or signing style, edit `project.yml` and regenerate with `./scripts/generate_project.sh`


## Permissions
WakeyWakey needs Accessibility permission to post input events (mouse moves). On first launch, the app automatically opens System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility with WakeyWakey highlighted. Grant permission and relaunch the app.

If the prompt doesn't appear, manually navigate to:
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
- Add WakeyWakey and toggle it on, then restart the app


## Roadmap
Planned/possible enhancements once the core is stable:
- Zen Mode: "invisible" activity (e.g., 0-pixel mouse move)
- Preferences (UserDefaults) for interval tuning and modes
- Status in menu (idle time, action counter)
- Configurable strategies (mouse only, keyboard nudge, mixed)
- About dialog


## Troubleshooting
- No menu bar icon appears
  - Ensure you’re running the app from /Applications and that `LSUIElement` is true (it is set in Info.plist)
- Menu not responding to clicks
  - Quit and relaunch; the status item is configured with target/action as required
- App doesn’t seem to “jiggle”
  - Jiggle only happens after 42 seconds of inactivity; move away from the mouse/keyboard for ~45 seconds to test
- Jiggle occurs while typing
  - Idle detection now considers explicit keyboard and mouse event types (min across keyDown/keyUp/flagsChanged and mouse events) to avoid jiggles during active typing. If this still occurs in your environment, we can switch to an event-tap or IOKit-based idle detection. (Change implemented in `AppDelegate.tick()`.)
- Cannot control the mouse
  - Ensure Accessibility permission is granted and the app has been relaunched after granting
- Pointer jumps to the primary display during jiggle on multi-monitor setups (including DisplayLink)
  - Movements are clamped to the current screen and coordinates are anchored to the main display to avoid cross-display snapping. If issues persist, restart DisplayLink Manager, re-plug displays, and re-grant Accessibility permission for WakeyWakey, then relaunch. (Fix implemented in `AppDelegate.performActivity()`.)
- Gatekeeper warning on another Mac
  - Control-click the app and choose Open; confirm the dialog


## Notes
- Uses AppKit (not SwiftUI), with a required `main.swift` for proper menu bar initialization
- Sets `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` in AppDelegate.init()
- Uses IOKit's IOPM assertions to prevent system idle sleep
- Uses ApplicationServices to post CGEvents for subtle mouse movement
- Uses ServiceManagement's SMAppService for Launch at Login integration
- Uses AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions() to auto-open Accessibility settings
- Idle detection: minimum across explicit keyboard and mouse event types via `CGEventSource.secondsSinceLastEventType` (Option A)
- 52% center bias for jiggles keeps the cursor from drifting to edges over long sessions
- The app icon in /Applications is set from the provided icon asset; the menu bar icon uses SF Symbols (cup) templates for light/dark mode
